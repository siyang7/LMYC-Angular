    <p>You don't need to own a boat or even know how to sail in order become a member of one of White Rock's best kept secrets
      – the Lower Mainland Yacht Co-op (LMYC). All you need is an interest in sailing.</p>

    <p>You can learn to be a skipper on one of our seven boats; join the fun on long weekend cruises or simply sail around Semiahmoo
      Bay with other members... all for an affordable price!</p>

    <p>The Lower Mainland Yacht Cooperative (LMYC) consists of 115 "Full" members and six sailboats moored at the end of the
      pier. We have three C&C 27’s MK3, a Catalina 28 Mk2. a Cal 25 MK2 and a 27' C&C MK5. Aside from a membership fee, members
      are required to contribute a minimum of 20 hours of their time to either boat maintenance or other club tasks.</p>

    <p>The most important aspect of the cooperative is the maintenance of the boats. All boats are kept in good condition as
      a result of regular maintenance, including scheduled Maintenance Days, which are on the Saturday morning following
      the General Meeting of each month. Each boat has it’s own Maintenance Crew and Leader. Most Maintenance Day crew members
      are scheduled for six times per year.</p>

    <p>Annual bottom painting and minor upgrading are done early each season. Co-op members do most of this work; professional
      trades are hired as needed. This is an excellent opportunity to learn the workings of the boats while getting to know
      your fellow sailors.</p>

    <p>Boats are booked on a first come, first serve basis, each member being allocated 320 hours of sailing during the "high
      season" months of June, July and August. This allows for a week of sailing during this peak period if accompanied by
      three non-member guests/crew. During the balance of the year, a member's booking hours are unlimited.</p>

    <p>As a full member, you can join in the fun on the long weekend "Club Cruises" to gorgeous destinations in the Gulf Islands.
      Your nominal fee for the weekend includes most provisions and expenses. Saturday morning you leave for a beautiful
      3-day trip to some of BC's most beautiful spots.</p>

    <p>The fact that we usually have a waiting list for full membership points to the value and popularity of our club. Often
      all of those wishing full membership are able to transfer from social member status by the February following their
      application.</p>

    <p>Once the application to full membership is accepted, the 2018 initiation fee of $200 plus the annual fee of $700 [total
      amount = $900] is payable prior to January 31st. There are no refunds on memberships.</p>

    <p>Those on our waiting list pay $25 per year. They are referred to as "Social Members" and are entitled to attend all member
      meetings and social functions. Associate members stay at the top of the waiting list, pay $50 per year, and are also
      welcome at all member meetings and social functions.</p>
