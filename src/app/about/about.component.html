  <h2>Organization</h2>

  <p>The Lower Mainland Yacht Cooperative (LMYC) is a provincially registered
    and regulated non-profit organization, which is owned and operated by its
    members. LMYC is governed by the British Columbia Co-operative Act.</p>

  <p>The mission and purpose of the Lower Mainland Yacht co-op is to promote
    Affordable, Safe and Enjoyable recreational sailing.</p>

  <p>As a co-op, it is possible to provide boats, equipment and sailing skill
    development at a fraction of the cost of any other sailing program you can
    find. The low cost, however, does require full participation of the members
    to make it succeed. All members are expected to contribute time for boat
    maintenance or helping with other activities toward our common goal.</p>

  <h2>Operations</h2>
  <p>To maintain our co-op interest and it's continuing success, an annual election
    is held in February to select the Commodore, First and Second Vice Commodores,
    Treasurer and Secretary.</p>

  <p>Meetings are held on the third Thursday of each month, except July, August
    and December. Meetings are held at the Rotary Field House in White Rock at
    1930 hours. Annual dues are payable by February 1st each year. The Annual
    General Meeting is held at the February meeting.</p>
